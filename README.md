-------------The Silliest Teacher in School
BY DARREN SARDELLI
Our teacher gave detention
to the fountains in the hall.
She handed extra homework
to the artwork on the wall.
 
We saw her point a finger
at a banner and a sign.
She said their bad behavior
was completely out of line.
 
The principal approached her
and said, “What is all this fuss?
I heard you tried to punish
all the tires on a bus.
 
“You’ve made the teachers angry
by disrupting all their classes,
so if you want to keep this job,
you have to wear your glasses!”

Another change on Jun 27.
